### What is this is?
Just a starting point that I recreate all to often when setting up projects
Its my mixture of resources that I use when prototyping and designing

I've grown to like it.  And I'll probably keep updating it as time goes by.

Couple of notes:

- Its all in SASS.  If you like SCSS, Stylus, or even Less.  Feel free to convert it.
- If you want to use it, the files are just suggestions, do with it what you like.
- If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ping me.
